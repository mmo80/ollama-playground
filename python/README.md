This code is designed to dynamically generate and execute commands based on specific queries. For example, when asking "Vad är vädret i Göteborg?" (meaning "What is the weather in Gothenburg?"), it compiles and executes the necessary code to obtain and present the current weather conditions in Gothenburg. Likewise, querying "What is the current price of BTC?" triggers the code to run a designated function that fetches and returns the most recent price of Bitcoin.
